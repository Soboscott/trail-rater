## User Story:

I was out in the forest merrily running along when I came across three entrepreneurs.  They specialize in start up web companies.  I told them I was a web developer and they said “well that’s a coincidence we were out for a walk while our dinner was cooling off and were wishing there were an app that could help us review the trails we like.” I said well tell me what you would like in the app.
    The big one said “I would like an app where I can review trails I have been on.”
    The medium one said “I would like an app that I could update or delete my musings for the trails on my list.”
    The small one said” I would like an app that I could see specific reviews on the trails I have on my list.”
I told them that I could do something like that but I asked if there were anything else they would like on the app.
    The big one said “I want to be able to sign in to my profile with a password.”
    The medium one said “I want to be able to change my password from time to time.”
    The small one said “At this point I’m just looking to check out!”

 ## Additional modifications
 I would like to add some additional features like:
    1. Adding a adtabase from the Recreation Information Database (RIDB).
    2. Creating a  search functions to search by reviewer.
    3. Adding visual styles such as animation and images.
