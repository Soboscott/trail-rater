## User Story:

I was out in the forest merrily running along when I came across three entrepreneurs.  They specialize in start up web companies.  I told them I was a web developer and they said “well that’s a coincidence we were out for a walk while our dinner was cooling off and were wishing there were an app that could help us review the trails we like.” I said well tell me what you would like in the app.
    The big one said “I would like an app where I can review trails I have been on.”
    The medium one said “I would like an app that I could update or delete my musings for the trails on my list.”
    The small one said” I would like an app that I could see specific reviews on the trails I have on my list.”
I told them that I could do something like that but I asked if there were anything else they would like on the app.
    The big one said “I want to be able to sign in to my profile with a password.”
    The medium one said “I want to be able to change my password from time to time.”
    The small one said “At this point I’m just looking to check out!”

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## 3rd Party APIs


 Recreation Information Database (RIDB) Application Programming Interface (API).
 Authentication

The RIDB API uses keys to allow access. Registration is free and your key is available to you immediately upon registration. Register for an API key here.

The RIDB API allows two approaches for authentication with the API key:

In an HTTP header that looks like the following: apikey:thisIsMyKey
In a URL parameter that looks like the following: ?apikey=thisIsMyKey
 You must replace thisIsMyKey with your personal API key found on your RIDB profile page.

 ## Additional modifications
 I would like to add some additional features like:
 being able to search trails by state, park, trail name.
